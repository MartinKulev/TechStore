# App
This is a simulation of a web store with functionalities such as: Login, Register with email verification, Profile management, Adding products to cart, Removing products from cart, Applying promocodes, Leaving reviews, Making payments, Viewing order history, and more. The app comprises two roles: "User" and "Admin". Upon registration, each new account is automatically assigned the "User" role. The "Admin" role is directly assigned from the database, granting administrators access to a distinct layout on the website compared to regular users. Admins possess full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities over Products, Users, Promocodes, and Categories through their dedicated administration panel.
